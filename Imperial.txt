Hi Indah this is your very firt project using GIT and GitHUB wohoo congrats :) You did it. 
Remember to use GIT locally using command promt and it's ZSH in Mac OS but in case you gonna use another OS you gotta learn new terminal.
Here We could edit our file, You could create any file here like txt/ python or any others file. 
You could push your file to GitHub from your local git and 
You could pull your file from GitHub to the Local GIT.

Here is to remember that you need to set up the SSH Key first in order to push your GIT Locally to GitHub...
because GIT now is not supporting HTTPS anymore. haha
